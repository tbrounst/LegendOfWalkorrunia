The Legend of Walkorrunia
=========================
**Walkorrunia**: n. (Walk-or-run-ee-uh)  
1) A fictitious location with a ridiculous name.  
2) A prototype java project with big, big dreams.

Running and contributing to this project
----------------------------------------
This project was developed using [Netbeans IDE](/netbeans.org/) and I recommend using it should you wish to run the project and/or contribute code. You are, of course, welcome to use whatever environment you would like (just know that the `/nbproject` folder is going to stay and there's nothing you can do about it).

**Requirements**
- Java 8.something (latest stable) SE
- Ant 1.8 or better
- _pending: Postgresql_

**Troubleshooting**  
Convincing Netbeans to play nice with git has been a bit of a nuisance. If you find that you cannot simply clone the project, open it, and run it normally in Netbeans, there is most likely a problem in your local version of the `/nbproject` directory's contents.
